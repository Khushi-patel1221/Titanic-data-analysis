This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The analysis involves calculating survival rates, class distribution, and other important factors affecting passenger survival.

# Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in data science and is often used for beginners. In this project, we perform a detailed EDA to uncover patterns and insights that influenced survival on the Titanic.

# Dataset Information
Train Data: train.csv - Contains features like passenger details, class, fare, age, and survival status.
Test Data: test.csv - Contains similar features but without survival status.
Gender Submission Data: gender_submission.csv - A sample submission file for Kaggle competitions.

# Key Objectives
Calculate the overall survival rate.
Analyze the survival rate across different passenger classes.
Explore the impact of gender, age, and other features on survival.
Visualize the insights using charts and plots.
